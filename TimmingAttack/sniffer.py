    """
    Sniffer provides a general-purpose packet sniffer, that binds to a
    particular network interface and captures all traffic that passes through
    it.

    A sniffer is asynchronous from the application that invokes it, and can
    be controlled through a simple interface:

    Example:

      s = Sniffer('eth0')
      s.start()
      sleep(10)
      s.flush()
      s.stop()

      print "Caught %d packets." % (len(s.pcap()))

    The intercepted packets are available through the #pcap() method, or by
    subscribing to the on_receive callback, which will push packets as they
    are received.
